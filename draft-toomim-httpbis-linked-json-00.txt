Abstract

   Linked JSON is an extension to JSON that defines a new datatype: a
   "Link".  A Link has a URI, and may have metadata.

   Links allow JSON objects to compose across websites, supporting
   transclusion.  Optional metadata on links can be used to specify a
   specific version or sub-slice of data to link to.

1.  Introduction

   JSON documents often include URIs, or references to other documents,
   as strings.  It is often useful to distinguish which strings actually
   represent URIs, for example, to fetch and include the contents of
   links, or to translate relative to absolute URIs.

   Linked JSON is an extension of JSON that adds a Link datatype, so that
   URIs can be distinguished from ordinary strings.

1.1.  Syntax

   A Link is encoded as a JSON object with a field named "link":

     { "link": "/david-macaulay" }

   Any object with a field named "link" is interpreted as a Link.  The
   value of the link field MUST be a string containing a URI [RFC3986].

   Links MAY be embedded within arbitrary JSON:

     {
       "book-name": "The way things work",
       "image"      { "link": "/the-way-things-work.jpg" },
       "author":    { "link": "/david-macaulay" }
     }

1.2.  Escaping

   To encode a field named "link" *without* creating a Link, prefix the
   field with an underscore:

     { "_link": "this is not a link" }

   To encode "_link", prefix it with two underscores: "__link".  To
   encode "__link", use "___link", and so on.

1.3.  Metadata

   Links MAY specify metadata on other fields of the JSON object.

   For instance, a "version" field could be used to specify a specific
   version to link to:

     {
       "message": "Hey guys! I just published a new draft!",
       "attachment: {
         "link": "/books/the-way-things-work",
         "version": "4.0.5"
       }
     }

   The metadata in [RFC8288] could also be expressed.

   Or a GraphQL [GRAPHQL] query:

     { "link": "/foo", "range": "(bar:9)[3,4]" }


2.  Related Work

   See [MNOT] for a survey of related work.  Linked JSON is most similar
   to [JSONREF], but has the following differences:

     - It names the special field "link" instead of "$ref".

     - It provides an escape hatch for when users need to encode the
       string "link".

     - It allows metadata to be specified on links.

     - The contents of a link need not be JSON.

   This enables software to automatically differentiate Links from
   strings.  Software could then automatically fetch, cache, and
   transclude the author object into the book object, for instance, or
   transform the relative link to absolute.

   JSON-LD [JSONLD] also supports linking in JSON, but requires a number
   of other features to be implemented as well.  Linked JSON is lighter
   and easier to implement for the specific purpose of linking JSON.

   (Todo: compare with HAL, Siren, JSON:API, and Collection+JSON as
   described at https://github.com/badgateway/ketting)

3.  Resolution

   Resolution of a Link SHOULD yield the referenced value.

   If the URI contained in the JSON Reference value is a relative URI,
   then the base URI resolution MUST be calculated according to
   [RFC3986], Section 5.2.  Resolution is performed relative to the
   referring document.

4.  Media Type

   Linked JSON resources MAY use the media type
   "application/linked-json".
