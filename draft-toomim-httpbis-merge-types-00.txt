Abstract

   Merge Types specify how to merge multiple simultaneous edits to a
   resource.  This happens when two computers edit the same state over a
   network with latency.  A Merge Type specifies how to merge
   conflicting changes.  If the computers implement and agree upon the
   same Merge Type, then they can guarantee to reach a consistent state,
   after arbitrary edits, eventually.

   You can define new Merge Types.  This document defines Merge Types,
   the structure of the Merge Type system, and IANA registration
   procedures for Merge Types.

1.  Introduction

   In a version history, a merge type defines the output of a version
   that is derived from two or more parent versions:

                   _
             Time: |        birds
                   |        /   \
                   |     dogs   cats
                   |        \   /
                   V       dogcats   <-- merged version


   This can be ambiguous if two or more edits overlap, and edit the same
   thing in different ways. It is desireable if all computers resolve
   ambiguities in the same way, because then they will achieve
   consistent results.  In the example above, one person replaced "bird"
   with "dog", while the other replaced it with "cat", creating an
   ambiguity, which the Merge Type resolved by merging these edits
   together into "dogcats".  Some other Merge Type might resolve this
   ambiguity differently.

   Currently popular approaches are using conflict-free replicated data
   types [CRDT] or operational transformation [OT].  Different
   algorithms that merge in different ways.  Different applications need
   different parts of their data to merge in different ways.  The Merge
   Type specifies the outcome of a merge.  Different algorithms can
   implement the same Merge Type to interoperate.

   If a Merge Type is specified for a region of data, and all computers
   implement that Merge Type, then they can guarantee to obtain the same
   resulting state, no matter the order that events arrive over the
   network, or the algorithms they use to implement the Merge Types.

   This document defines how to specify a Merge Type within a
   standardized naming scheme.

1.1.  Merge Types vary across applications

   Different resources merge in different ways, and can use different
   merge types.  For example, if a string represents a collaborative
   text document, then parallel edits should be merged together.  But if
   a string represents a database entry ID and it is modified by two
   requests simultaneously, the appropriate behavior is to choose one or
   the other.

   Similarly, if the resource is a number that represents a bank account
   balance, then it should merge multiple simultaneous debits by adding
   the amounts of the debits together.

   Thus, it is nice to re-use a Merge Type across multiple types of
   data; and each application has different needs for how its data
   should merge.

1.2.  A Merge Type is specified as a function

   A Merge Type is a function that produces a merged state when provided
   with any set of parent versions:

                         Merge Type

             (parent, parent, ..) -> merged state

   A Merge Type must be a deterministic function.  Given the same set of
   parents that descend from the same version history, it should always
   return the same resulting merged state.  This guarantees eventual
   consistency.

   To compute the result, a Merge Type has access to the entire version
   history that preceded each of the parents, but it cannot depend on
   information outside of that version history.

   A Merge Type might only work on a particular Content-Type. For
   instance, a "counter" Merge Type only works on numbers.  A Merge Type
   SHOULD state any limitations in the set of states that it is capable
   of operating upon, and any assumptions it makes about the data.

   But given that it has data that meets those assumptions, a Merge Type
   MUST return a result when merging any set of versions.  A Merge Type
   cannot perform any validation on new versions.

2.  Definitions

   For the purpose of this document we define "synchronization" as the
   resolution of conflicts.  There are multiple approaches to resolving
   conflicts and we define "Merge Type" an identifier that corresponds
   to an approach of resolving conflicts.

3.  Merge Type Naming

   Naming of Merge Type follows naming requirements of media types as
   described in Section 4.2. of [RFC6838] with the following exception:
   Merge Type names consist only of a type-name without a sub-type.

   Similarly, Merge Type parameters follow Section 4.3. of [RFC6838].

   Example:

     automerge-counter
     sharedb-json; variant=1
     biggest-wins; sortby=versionid

4.  IANA Considerations

4.1.  Merge Type Registry

   The "Merge Type Registry" defines the namespace for the merge type
   names and refers to their corresponding specifications.  The registry
   will be created and maintained at
   <http://www.iana.org/assignments/merge-types>.

4.1.1.  Procedure

   Registration of a Merge Type MUST include the following fields:

   o  Type name

   o  Required parameters

   o  Optional parameters

   o  Description

   o  Security considerations

   o  Interoperability considerations

   o  Published specification

   o  Person & email address to contact for further information

   Values to be added to this namespace require IETF Review (see
   [RFC5226], Section 4.1).

4.1.2.  Registrations

4.1.3.  Comments on Merge Type Registrations

   Comments on registered Merge Types may be submitted by members of the
   community to the IANA at iana@iana.org.  These comments will be
   reviewed by the Merge Types reviewer and then passed on to the
   "owner" of the Merge Type if possible.  Submitters of comments may
   request that their comment be attached to the Merge Type registration
   itself; if the IANA, in consultation with the Merge Types reviewer,
   approves, the comment will be made accessible in conjunction with the
   type registration.

4.1.4.  Change Procedures

   Once a Merge Type has been published by the IANA, the owner may
   request a change to its definition.  The same procedure that would be
   appropriate for the original registration request is used to process
   a change request.

   Merge Type registrations may not be deleted; Merge Types that are no
   longer believed appropriate for use can be declared OBSOLETE; such
   Merge Types will be clearly marked in the list published by the IANA.

   Significant changes to a Merge Type's definition should be requested
   only when there are serious omissions or errors in the published
   specification.  When review is required, a change request may be
   denied if it renders entities that were valid under the previous
   definition invalid under the new definition.

   The owner of a Merge Type may pass responsibility to another person
   or agency by informing the IANA; this can be done without discussion
   or review.

   The IESG may reassign responsibility for a Merge Type.  The most
   common case of this will be to enable changes to be made to types
   where the author of the registration has died, moved out of contact,
   or is otherwise unable to make changes that are important to the
   community.

5.  Security Considerations

   An analysis of security issues SHOULD be done for all registered
   Merge Types.  However, regardless of what security analysis has or
   has not been done, all descriptions of security issues MUST be as
   accurate as possible.  In particular, the security considerations
   MUST NOT state that there are "no security issues associated with
   this Merge Type".  Security considerations for Merge Types MAY state
   that "the security issues associated with this Merge Type have not
   been assessed".

   There is absolutely no requirement that Merge Types registered be
   secure or completely free from risks.  Nevertheless, all known
   security risks MUST be identified in the registration of a Merge
   Type.

   The security considerations section of all registrations is subject
   to continuing evaluation and modification, and in particular MAY be
   extended by use of the "comments on Merge Types" mechanism described
   in Section 4.1.3 above.

   Some of the issues that need to be examined and described in a
   security analysis of a Merge Type are:

     o Merge Types might operate in a way that, while not directly
       harmful, may result in disclosure of information that either
       facilitates a subsequent attack or else violates user's privacy
       in some way.

     o A Merge Type should be considered in concert with a Validator.
       For instance, it is possible for two transactions A and B to both
       be valid individually, but when merged, the result is not valid.
       For instance, if a bank account has $1, then two simultaneous
       debits of $1 are both valid individually, but the resulting
       merger, yielding -$2, drains the bank account balance below $0.  
       This is the double-spend problem.  A system using Merge Types
       SHOULD be aware of how its Merge Types interact with its
       Validators.
