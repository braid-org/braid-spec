# Braid: Adding Synchronization to HTTP

This is the working area for the [Braid](https://braid.org) extensions to
HTTP in the [IETF HTTP Working Group](https://httpwg.org/).  These extensions
add Synchronization to HTTP.  They are authored in three documents:

### Braid HTTP — [`draft-toomim-httpbis-braid-http-04.txt`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/braid-org/braid-spec/master/draft-toomim-httpbis-braid-http-04.txt)

Braid adds to HTTP:
1. *Versioning* of resource history
2. *Updates* sent as patches
3. *Subscriptions* to updates over time
4. *Merge-Types* that specify OT or CRDT behavior

### Range Patch — [`draft-toomim-httpbis-range-patch-01.txt`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/braid-org/braid-spec/master/draft-toomim-httpbis-range-patch-01.txt)

A uniform approach for expressing changes to state over HTTP.  Generalizes
Range Requests to other HTTP methods.  Defines the replacement of a range with
a new value.

### Merge Types — [`draft-toomim-httpbis-merge-types-00.txt`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/braid-org/braid-spec/master/draft-toomim-httpbis-merge-types-00.txt)

Merge Types specify how to consistently merge a set of simultaneous
conflicting edits to a resource.  If multiple computers implement the same
Merge Type, they can guarantee eventual consistency after arbitrary
multi-writer edits.

### Linked JSON — [`draft-toomim-httpbis-linked-json-00.txt`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/braid-org/braid-spec/master/draft-toomim-httpbis-linked-json-00.txt)

Linked JSON is an extension of JSON that adds a Link datatype, so that URIs
can be distinguished from ordinary strings.  This allows JSON documents to
be nested inside other JSON documents.
