Abstract

   NelSON is "JSON as Ted Nelson would design it."

   NelSON is an extension to JSON where any region can be framed with a
   URI and HTTP Metadata.  Regions with the same URI refer to the same
   content, and can be transcluded into other regions, with metadata
   specifying how they connect.

1.  Introduction

   NelSON is an extension of JSON, where any object with a field named
   "uri" is a special Hypermedia wrapper, which can specify a URI link
   for the region of JSON it wraps and optional metadata:

         { uri: "/this-ietf-spec", val: "Framed JSON is JSON with ..." }

   NelSON is valid JSON.  A NelSON Hypermedia wrapper can be used to
   insert a link inside JSON.  For instance, in the JSON for a book, one
   could include a link to the author:

         {
           "book-name": "The way things work",
           "author":    { "uri": "/david-macaulay" }
           "image"      { "uri": "/the-way-things-work.jpg", ContentType: "image/png" },
         }

   val is optional.  If not present, it's just a pointer.  It may be
   present, and refer to a cache of the data.  If uri: null, then it
   SHOULD have a val.

   NelSON can be used to distinguish which strings in JSON actually
   represent URIs, for example, to fetch and include the contents of
   links, or to translate relative to absolute URIs.

1.1.  Syntax

   A NelSON Hypermedia wrapper is encoded as a JSON object with a field
   named "uri":

     { "uri": "/david-macaulay" }

   Any object with a field named "uri" is interpreted as a wrapper.  The
   value of the uri field MUST be either a string containing a URI
   [RFC3986], or null.

1.2.  Escape Syntax

   To include an actual object with a field "uri", you must escape the
   field with an underscore:

         { "_uri": "foo" }

   A field named "_uri" is escaped as "__uri", and so on.

1.3.  Metadata

   Links MAY specify metadata on other fields of the JSON object.

   For instance, a "version" field could be used to specify a specific
   version to link to:

     {
       "message": "Hey guys! I just published a new draft!",
       "attachment: {
         "link": "/books/the-way-things-work",
         "version": "4.0.5"
       }
     }

   The metadata in [RFC8288] could also be expressed.

   Or a GraphQL [GRAPHQL] query:

     { "link": "/foo", "slice": "(bar:9)[3,4]" }

2.  Related Work

   A number of related formats are surveyed in [MNOT].

   This draft borrows from [JSONREF], but makes the following changes:

     - It names the special field "link" instead of "$ref".

     - It provides an escape hatch for when users need to encode the
       string "link".

     - It allows metadata to be specified on links.

     - The contents of a link need not be JSON.

   This enables software to automatically differentiate Links from
   strings.  Software could then automatically fetch, cache, and
   transclude the author object into the book object, for instance, or
   transform the relative link to absolute.

   JSON-LD [JSONLD] also supports linking in JSON, but bundles a number
   of other features as well, making it more difficult to implement.

3.  Resolution

   Resolution of a Link SHOULD yield the referenced value.

   If the URI contained in the JSON Reference value is a relative URI,
   then the base URI resolution MUST be calculated according to
   [RFC3986], Section 5.2.  Resolution is performed relative to the
   referring document.

4.  Media Type

   Linked JSON resources MAY use the media type
   "application/linked-json".
