Invisible Property License

   1. You have the right to use this IP for any purpose.
   2. If you make profit, you agree to give back a fair share of the profit to
      the creators of this IP.
   3. The creators will tell you how much they think is a fair share, if your
      usage matters to them, and promise not to take you to court to enforce
      the agreement.

(In other words, this license thus runs on the honor system.  You are invited
to participate in our community with honor.)
